# Experiment 006 — Object Detection in video stream

**Date:** 23 April 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Phase:** 1 — V-Module  

---

## Objective
Using Yolo model and finetuned embeddings to detect objects in a video stream

---

## Configuration

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Dataset | coco dataset trained|
| Model  | Yolo |
| Started from checkpoint | Yes — Exp_005 |

---

## Result

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Status | Success |


---

## Observations
- Objection detection with low light condition and bright light condition were quit good but due to camera issues and light, objects were sometimes were classified wrongly for breif moment
- we were able to detect the objects successfully in video stream

---

## Bugs / Issues
- session cache cause notebook code using old modules, a quick restart if kernel helped to work correctly

---

## Key Lesson
Learnt how objection detection happens in video streams, similar machenism is used in automated cars and many computer vision systems

---

## Next Step
→ Experiment 007: bench marking visual module through video stream
